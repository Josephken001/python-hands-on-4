Task 2: Airport Luggage Tracker
At Jos Airport, the luggage department tracked passengers and their luggage weights:

luggage = [("Alice", 23),( "Bob", 18), ("Charlie", 25)]

- you need to map each user to its corresponding luggage weight value.

Before the flight took off:
- A late passenger "Daisy" checked in with 20kg of luggage.
- Bobâ€™s luggage went missing.
- The staff prepared a daily report before resetting for the next flight.
